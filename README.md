## Goals
- Stay around 150 lines of code
- Be easy to modify and extend
- Have no external dependencies

## Non-Goals
- Support MacOS, Windows and other non-standard terminals
- Restarting tests
- Themes, other languages, statistics

If you add a feature that some might find useful, send me a patch and I might add it to the README.

This runs on st and alacritty, if your terminal is weird you'll need to modify the code to work with it.
